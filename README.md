# OTA-PCT

This repository hosts code and related resources for research on **Learning-based Geometry Point Cloud Transmission**.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository includes two major components:

### 1. [SEPT](https://github.com/aprilbian/SEPT)

The first folder contains the full codebase of [SEPT](https://github.com/aprilbian/SEPT), a conference paper which focuses on the transmission of small point cloud datasets generated by downsampling the point clouds in ShapeNet.

Please refer to the [SEPT repository](https://github.com/aprilbian/SEPT) for full details.

### 2. [OTA-MetaNeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08730) (accepted to IEEE JSAC SI on Intelligent Communications for Real-Time Computer Vision (Comm4CV))

The second folder contains the implementation of the *OTA-MetaNeRF* framework of the paper **Over-the-Air Learning-based Geometry Point Cloud Transmission**, this scheme considers transmitting point clouds using neural network weights, and adopts Meta learning to accelerate encoding process.

This work adopts the principle of [Coinpp](https://github.com/EmilienDupont/coinpp) and apply it for efficient (real-time) and effective 3d point cloud transmission. Unlike SEPT for small-scale point clouds, this scheme is generalizable to all point cloud inputs.
